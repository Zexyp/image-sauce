#### **_The worst idea ever. (I have no idea how I came up with it (pls don't kill me)) It's just a test._**

### __Finaly description__
This is a python program that you can use to search images on Bing. It's giving mostly unpredictable results and might seem like it's not working.

## __The usage is simple (and description)__
  - At the start of the program you can search whatever you want.
  - After the program fineshes it's thing you should see a image of what you searched (it mostly doesn't work or it gives error or it crashes).
  - You can than type:
    - `/next` to show next result of the search
    - `/prev` to show previous result of the search
    - `/` to search again
    - `/quit` or just `/q` to quit
    - `/filter` to see all filters
      - `/filter "name of the filter"` to see filter's options
        - `/filter "name of the filter" "INDEX of the option"`
        - Example: `/filter color 3` â†’ Activates color filter with option 3 which is red.
        
*The program only searches for jpg images and outputs with no color!*
